    "1. Load text files into the notebook.\n",
    "2. Split the contents of the text files into the main article and provided highlights.\n",
    "3. Extract the publishing dates from the raw HTML files.\n",
    "4. Combine the previous returns into a dictionary that can be converted into a pandas dataframe.\n",

    "WARNING: Full iteration through the entire directory is time consuming. There are over 90,000 stories, so this means their are 180,000 files being iterated through if the get_date function is included. There is a build in break commented out in the load_stories that can limit the number of files you want to extract."
